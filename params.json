{"name":"Html2faxcover","tagline":"Alternative to AvantFax's faxcover. The program is a bit more general than that, but AvantFax was the inspiration.","body":"Introduction:<br />\r\n    This project came about when I tried setting up a fax server at my aunt's business. Unfortunately, AvantFax's faxcover.php was having trouble creating a database object and connecting to the database. AvantFax connects to the MySQL database in order to obtain the name and e-mail of the sending user and putting it in the coversheet automatically. I decided that I could have a better control over the problem if I created a C++ program that would connect to this database directly. I decided to call the program html2faxcover, because I want this program to be a replacement for AvantFax's or any other fax server system's html to coversheet conversion utility. Currently, this program is not a completely standalone utility. <br /> <br />\r\n\r\nRequirements:<br />\r\n  --This program requires that html2ps or a similar utility is available in your system.<br />\r\nStatus:<br />\r\n  The program works offline, but I have to fix an issue when using AvantFax's interface, which is through a browser and considered outside access to the server (thus there's some permission restrictions).<br />","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
